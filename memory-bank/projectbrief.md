# Project Brief: RavenDB MCP Server

## Overview

The RavenDB MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with RavenDB databases through a standardized interface. It provides a clean abstraction layer allowing AI systems to perform common RavenDB operations.

## Core Objectives

1. Enable AI assistants to interact with RavenDB 7.x databases
2. Provide a standardized interface for database operations
3. Support non-secured mode authentication (certificate-based auth planned for future)
4. Maintain persistent connections between tool calls
5. Implement core RavenDB operations: queries, document management, collection exploration

## Target Users

Companies using RavenDB in production environments who wish to enable AI assistant interaction with their databases.

## Implementation Scope

The initial implementation will focus on:

- Core connection management
- Basic read/write operations
- Authentication methods
- Essential query capabilities
- Simple document operations

## Success Metrics

1. Successful integration with AI assistants
2. Reliable database operations
3. Clear error handling and recovery
4. Easy configuration and setup
5. Comprehensive documentation

## Out of Scope

- Advanced RavenDB features (attachments, time series, etc.)
- Performance optimizations (initial phase)
- Streaming capabilities for large result sets
- Query building helpers
- Additional administrative tools

## Timeline

Development is planned in 4 phases:

1. Core Infrastructure with Non-secured Mode Auth
2. Basic Tools
3. Additional Tools
4. Packaging & Documentation

This project brief serves as the foundation for all development activities and documentation.
