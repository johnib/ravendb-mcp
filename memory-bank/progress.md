## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 3-4 (Additional Tools/Documentation)  
**Overall Progress**: ~85% Complete  
**Next Milestone**: Packaging, Documentation, and Testing

## What Works

The project has progressed substantially with the following in place:

- Full project structure established
- Core documentation created (PRD, README)
- All planned tools implemented
- All three authentication methods implemented
- Connection management system with persistence
- Error handling and validation
- Environment variable configuration
- MCP server with tool schema definitions

## What's Working In Progress

## Known Issues

The project is well-developed with core functionality in place. Current known issues and challenges include:

1. **Connection Persistence**: Ensuring reliable connection state maintenance between tool calls
2. **Authentication Complexity**: Managing multiple authentication methods securely
3. **Error Handling**: Creating informative error messages without exposing sensitive information
4. **Performance**: Managing response times, especially for larger queries
5. **Configuration**: Ensuring ease of setup while supporting multiple authentication methods

## Recent Progress

- All authentication methods implemented
- All planned tools implemented
- Connection management system with persistence in place
- Error handling framework established
- Input validation with Zod schemas implemented
- Response formatting standardized

## Up Next

1. Develop a comprehensive test suite
2. Create more example operations for documentation
3. Optimize performance for large result sets
4. Finalize packaging for distribution
5. Consider implementing streaming capabilities for large datasets

## Roadmap Alignment

The current work is at the intersection of Phase 3 (Additional Tools) and Phase 4 (Packaging & Documentation) of the implementation plan as described in the PRD. All core functionality has been implemented, with focus now on refinement, testing, and documentation.

## Blockers/Dependencies

- Need to establish testing framework and methodology
- Need to develop comprehensive test cases
- Need more examples for documentation
- Performance testing with large datasets required
