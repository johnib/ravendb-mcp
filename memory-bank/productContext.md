# Product Context: RavenDB MCP Server

## Problem Statement

Organizations using RavenDB databases often need to enable AI assistants to interact with their data, but there's no standardized interface for this purpose. Manual coding of integrations is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires deep knowledge of both AI systems and RavenDB.

## Solution

The RavenDB MCP Server provides a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with RavenDB databases directly. This eliminates the need for custom integrations while providing a secure, reliable interface.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Easy setup and configuration
2. **Reliability**: Stable connections to RavenDB
3. **Security**: Multiple authentication methods
4. **Flexibility**: Support for core RavenDB operations
5. **Error Resilience**: Clear error messages and recovery paths

## User Flow

1. User configures MCP server with RavenDB connection details
2. AI assistant connects to the MCP server
3. Assistant uses available tools to interact with the database
4. Server maintains connection state between operations
5. Operations execute with proper error handling and results formatting

## Key Features

### Authentication

- Certificate-based authentication (PFX or PEM)
- Non-secured mode (no authentication)

### Connection Management

- Persistent connections between tool calls
- Database context switching
- Connection state maintenance

### Data Operations

- Collection exploration
- Document retrieval, creation, and deletion
- Query execution
- Index inspection

## Integration Context

The RavenDB MCP Server integrates with:

1. **AI Assistants**: Through the Model Context Protocol
2. **RavenDB Servers**: Using the official RavenDB Node.js client
3. **Configuration Systems**: Via environment variables or .env files

## Measures of Success

1. AI assistants can successfully interact with RavenDB databases
2. Users can easily configure and deploy the server
3. Operations execute correctly with proper error handling
4. Connection management is reliable and persistent
5. Documentation is clear and comprehensive
